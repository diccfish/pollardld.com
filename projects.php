				<p>Floriduh is a side project of mine, where I tell "important" true stories about Florida. My goal is to, in a fun way, tell stories about Florida's animals, history, and environment, that I think people should know. I use some animation, scroll effects, and curse words to enhance the stories.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.notredameonline.com/" target="_blank">Notre Dame</a></h2>
				<p>Notre Dame is one of the many websites I worked on while at Bisk Education. I choose Notre Dame as an example, because it was one of the largest and most complex. The Notre Dame site includes, ecommerce, videos, articles, forms, live chat, and many more moving parts. It was a pleasure working with the team at Bisk. My responsibilities on this site included building the style framework that would need to be scalable and factor in so many moving parts. My Art Director <a href="http://www.thomgriggs.com/" target="_blank">Thom Griggs</a> and I did a job we can be proud of!</p>

				<h2><a href="projects/mobile/" target="_blank">Mobile Template</a></h2>
				<p>A lot of Research &amp; Development went into designing and developing the first mobile ready page for Bisk. I had never made something that would need to be used over and over again by other people of different skill levels, so I had a bit of a learning curve. But, with the help of my Art Directors I was able to pull it off, and learned a lot about the importance of using best practices, writing clean code, and thinking about others who may have to use my code without me there to explain it.</p>
